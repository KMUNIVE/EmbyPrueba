                <p>A Windows Service has been installed.</p>

                <p>Media Browser Server normally runs as a desktop application with a tray icon, but if you prefer to run it as a background service, it can be started from the windows services control panel instead.</p>

                <p>If using the windows service, please note that it cannot be run at the same time as the tray icon, so you'll need to exit the tray in order to run the service. The service will also need to be configured with administrative privileges via the control panel. Please note that at this time the service is unable to self-update, so new versions will require manual interaction.</p>
